        This is a comprehensive document about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn
        and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a 
        subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and 
        understand complex patterns in data.
        
        Natural language processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that focuses on the
        interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to read, 
        understand, and generate human language in a valuable way.
        
        Vector databases and embeddings are crucial technologies for modern AI applications,
        allowing for semantic search and similarity matching across large datasets.
