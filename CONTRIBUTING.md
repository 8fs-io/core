# Contributing to 8fs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to 8fs! We're building the first S3-compatible storage server with built-in vector storage for AI developers.

## üéØ Project Mission

8fs aims to be the "SQLite of AI storage" - simple, lightweight, and perfect for local AI development. We're focused on:
- Unified storage for models (S3) and embeddings (vectors) in one binary
- Raspberry Pi and edge deployment optimization  
- Zero-config setup with no external dependencies
- Developer-friendly APIs for AI workflows

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- SQLite3 (for development)
- Docker (optional, for testing)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and build**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/8fs-io/core.git
cd core
go mod download
go build -o 8fs ./cmd/server
```

2. **Run locally**:
```bash
./8fs
# Server starts on http://localhost:8080
```

3. **Test S3 API**:
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

# List buckets  
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Create bucket
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/test-bucket
```

4. **Test Vector API** (v0.1+):
```bash
# Store embedding
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/vectors/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "doc1", "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "metadata": {"type": "test"}}'

# Search similar
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/vectors/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], "top_k": 5}'
```

## üîß How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Bug Reports**: Use the "Bug Report" template with reproduction steps
- **Feature Requests**: Use the "Feature Request" template with use case details
- **Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general questions

### Code Contributions

#### 1. Find an Issue
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for newcomers
- Check `help wanted` for items needing attention
- Propose new features in GitHub Discussions first

#### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/core.git
cd core

# 3. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# 4. Make your changes
# 5. Test your changes
go test ./...

# 6. Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add vector search caching"

# 7. Push and create PR
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

#### 3. Pull Request Guidelines
- **Title**: Use conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **Description**: Explain what and why, not just how
- **Tests**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update README/docs if needed
- **Small PRs**: Keep changes focused and reviewable

### Code Style

#### Go Code Standards
- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors explicitly

#### Commit Message Format
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
- `feat: add vector similarity search`
- `fix: handle empty embedding arrays`
- `docs: update vector API examples`
- `test: add integration tests for S3 operations`
